# pico2
<p>small project that runs on a raspberry pi pico 2 WH (or just 'h') and Waveshare-Pico-LCD 1.14 V2</p>
<h1>This was made for a RaspPi Pico 2WH with a Waveshare Pico 1.14 inch LCD</h1>
<h3>(you could just swap out the driver (current is pico_lcd.py) with another but my game is meant specifically for 240x135 px)</h3>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>installing it is very easy, all you need is thonny and micropython on your device</p>
<p>using thonny you can put all of the files from the releases right on the pico and when you press run it will work</p>
<p>also if you own a different screen you are able to swap out st7789.py with your own screen driver from the manufacturer, you may just have to edit the top of main.py</p>
